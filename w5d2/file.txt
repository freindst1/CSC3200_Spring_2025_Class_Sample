Amazon is expected to tease a major AI-powered upgrade for its voice assistant Alexa later this month, one that could change how we interact with tech at home.
The company has sent out media invites for a Feb. 26 event in New York, where Panos Panay, who oversees Amazon's Devices and Services team, will be among the speakers. Panay joined Amazon last year after spending decades at Microsoft, where he helped shape the Surface product line.
